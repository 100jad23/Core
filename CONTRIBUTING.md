# How to contribute

First of all, thank you for showing interest in contributing to WeAreMahsaAmini initiative.

You can either help with an existing project, or initiate a new one.

Either way, please follow these steps:

1. Join our Discord channel [here](https://discord.gg/R76M7vedbe) for adhoc discussions and alignment.
2. Go to the #check-your-role channel and express your expertise using the available Emojis. This will help with recruitment for new projects.


## How can I contribute to existing projects?

1. Check out our shared Trello board [here](https://trello.com/w/wearemahsaamini).
2. At any time, we are working on multiple projects. Feel free to check out each project and choose the one that picks your interest.
3. Find a task that is under "To do" column and is relevant to your skill set. To claim a task, write a comment under it and the project lead will move it to the right column as soon as possible.
4. Most projects have a dedicated Discord channel under "PROJECTS" category. Make sure to review the channel (e.g. #celebrity-wall) before starting your contribution.
5. Have fun working on the task! ðŸŽ‰
6. Engineering tasks have a dedicated Github repository under [WeAreMahsaAmini](https://github.com/WeAreMahsaAmini) organization. Feel free to open an MR for review or when the coding is completed.
7. When the task is finished, add another comment under the Trello card and feel free to announce and celebrate it on the dedicated Discord channel.

> **Note**
>
> Tasks on the Trello board may have different labels based on the skills required. Tasks labeled with "Group work" can be picked up by more than one person, and you can usually find them under "In progress" column.


## How can I initiate a new project?

1. Check out the [Ideas section of the Core repository](https://github.com/WeAreMahsaAmini/Core/discussions), and make sure your idea hasn't been already listed there.
2. If the idea is labeled as "Under development" in the Ideas section, feel free to join the initiative on Discord.
3. If the idea is listed but not marked as "Under development", you can initiate the project in Discord. Mention the required skills (e.g. @Programming) in the #recruitment Discord channel to build your team. If enough members show interest, you can request one of the Discord admins to create a new Trello board and Github repository (if needed) for the project.
4. If the idea is not listed at all, post your idea on Github, and follow step 2.
