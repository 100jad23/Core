## What is the purpose of this repository?

The `Core` repository is designed to orchestrate all the different projects and build alignemnt. It includes, guidelines, ideas, discussions, etc. If you want to make changes to this repository, feel free to open an issue and suggest the change, or fork the project and open a pull request to the `main` branch.

You can find all the projects we're working on [here](https://github.com/orgs/WeAreMahsaAmini/repositories). 

## How to contribute?

### Participate in discussions

The discussions section is mostly designed for aligning contributors. In the discussions section, you can:

* [Introduce yourself](https://github.com/WeAreMahsaAmini/Core/discussions/new?category=introductions) and how your skills can benefit the movement (e.g. I'm a graphist and I can help with poster design)
* [Suggest a new idea](https://github.com/WeAreMahsaAmini/Core/discussions/new?category=ideas) that will help the movement (e.g. Twitter unsafe account detector)
* [Participate on existing ideas](https://github.com/WeAreMahsaAmini/Core/discussions/categories/ideas) by voting or commenting
* [Ask your questions](https://github.com/WeAreMahsaAmini/Core/discussions/new?category=q-a) related to the movement (e.g. How does Starlink work?) or the projects

### Work on projects

We are working on many different projects that we believe can help the movement. Each project require different skill sets and has its own contribution guidelines. [Here](https://github.com/orgs/WeAreMahsaAmini/repositories), you can find the one you're interested in.

## Governance

Since WeAreMahsaAmini is an open-source project we are going to govern it as a team.

1. Ideas are being introduced by the community
2. The idea will be picked up by a project lead
3. A new repository will be created and the project lead will become the owner of the repo
4. The project lead is responsible for creating the contribution guidelines for the project
5. If the lead of a project steps down or the project becomes stale, another project lead can claim the project

We are going to discuss as a community what are the minimum requirements for becoming a project lead.
